On behalf of all of my colleagues I would like to thank my predecessor and co founder of Mattioli Woods Bob Woods for his immense contribution in building our business into one of the UK s leading providers of wealth management and employee benefit services. Review of the year I am delighted to report another year of growth driven by a strong flow of organic new business and continued demand for advice from clients which together with acquisitions completed in this and the prior financial year has seen the Group achieve a significant milestone in generating annual revenues of over 50m. We have enjoyed further growth in our investment and asset management business with gross discretionary assets under management 4 AuM increasing by 460m during the year with 190m of new monies invested in our discretionary portfolio management service. The Mattioli Woods Structured Products Fund was launched in November 2016 and its value now exceeds 100m. Custodian REIT the UK real estate investment trust managed by our subsidiary Custodian Capital raised 76m of new monies during the year and now has a market capitalisation of almost 400m. One of our stated aims is to lower the cost of the range of services we provide to clients while growing a long term sustainable business. We were delighted to reduce the custody charge for all those clients using our core investment platform from 1 August 2017 which followed our previous announcement that the terms of the Investment Management Agreement between Custodian Capital and Custodian REIT have been amended to secure both a cost reduction for investors in Custodian REIT and an important long term revenue stream for the Group. Organic revenue growth of 11 6 2016 8 5 or 4 4m was driven by our largely home grown consultancy team further accelerated by growth in our investment and asset management and property businesses. We continue to see demand for advice from clients driven by lifestyle increasing longevity tax and other legislative changes including the pension freedoms that introduced a major shift in how people can access their pensions which in turn has driven further growth in pension consultancy and administration revenues. Acquisitions continue to be a core part of our growth strategy. Our purchase of
